How to (to the best of my knowledge) properly get GitHub and RStudio to work together

This is not code, sorry, just text.

------HOW GITHUB WORKS------
Every GitHub repository starts with a master branch. This branch is decisive copy of a project, and edits to the master branch should be done very cautiously. Instead of every team member working directly on the master branch (which would probably cause something to break irreparably), preliminary edits should be made on a new branch . When the new-branch is done, a pull request can be made. When the pull request is approved by the owner of the project, edits from the new branch will be merged into the master branch. The new-branch can then be deleted. 

There's a bit more to it, but that's the basic idea. 




------RStudio and GitHub------

--Going from RStudio to GitHub--

Make sure Git is installed before continuing. And also make a GitHub account
In RStudio, select Tools --> Version Control --> Git 
Tools --> Global Options --> Git/SVN
Confirm the path to the Git executable is correct
Select Create RSA key...
Close the resulting window
Select View public key, and copy the key
Go to your GitHub account, and open settings --> SSH keys --> Add SSH key --> Paste the copied public key
Back to Rstudio --> Tools --> Shell
  Type:
  git config --global user.email "example@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "exampleuser"
  Use your GitHub username
In RStudio, create a New Project --> New Directory
Name the project, and select "Create a git repository"
Make a new script, as normal. 
Saving the script results in it showing up in the Git tab in the panel that includes the Environment & History tab
Click the right file, and the status should turn to a green "A"
Commit the file, and write a comment in Commit message
The file is committed in the computer/server's repository, but not on GitHub
The file should be pushed to a GitHub repository
Create a new repository, or select the one you want
Back to RStudio Tools --> Shell
  Type:
  git remote add origin
  https://github.com/exampleuser/examplerepository.git
  git config remote.origin.url 
  git@github.com:exampleuser/examplerepository.git
  git pull -u origin master
  git push -u origin master
The file should be in GitHub, and the pull/push buttons in RStudio will now work

--GitHub to RStudio--
In RStudio: New Project --> Version Control --> Clone Git Repository
Enter the repository URL
Tools --> Shell
  Type:
  git config remote.origin.url
  git@github.com:exampleuser/examplerepository.git
